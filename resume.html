      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>I have 3 years of coding experience with C/C++, and working
        knowledge of both Git
        and
        GitHub. I'm eager to help design/develop video games and other creative coding and design-focused projects.
        I also have several
        years
        of experience
        programming in GameMaker Studio 2, from watching in-depth tutorials, to creating game prototypes.</p>

            <h3>Mask Mayhem</h3>
            <p>In this game, each player takes turns launching themselves towards the face of the human in the center of
              the
              room. They must avoid traps and launch above and between room objects to reach the face before the other
              player. This game was coursework done in CS 426, in the Department of CS at the University of Illinois
              Chicago. I pitched the original game idea and acted as the project manager for a 3-person team.</p>

            <h3>Pineapple Cleaning Products</h3>
            <p>In this VR project in the CAVE2™ Virtual Environment in the Electronic Visualization Lab at University of
              Illinois Chicago, each industrial detergent use worsens the surrounding water. Meanwhile, the
              pineapple cleaner interactions demonstrate the steps for creating detergent with pineapple scraps, with a
              cleaner, livelier body of water as a result. This was a interdisciplinary semester-long project completed
              alongside 2
              graphic design students.</p>

            <h3>Pest Guard</h3>
            <p>This prototype, named Pest Guard, aims to solve the issue that gardeners face in regards to pests, weeds,
              and figuring out how to deal with them. As the final project for our User Interface Design and Programming
              course, we focused on making a website that gardeners could easily understand. This was a 4-person team
              project developed throughout the semester. Works best on mobile devices.</p>

            <h3>Follow & Fool</h3>
            <p>As a pair, we developed the Mini Follow & Fool Arcade (formerly known as Mini Simon Says Arcade), a small
              arcade-like machine where two players can play a simple game, similar to the Simon Says children’s game
              where players must follow the commands of the CPU-controlled leader character, using buttons and a
              joystick.
              The game is played through one controller Arduino, and visually displayed through a display Arduino
              connected to an LCD screen, with a buzzer attached to the display as well.

            <h3>Dynamic VR Horror Game</h3>
            <p>This was a four-person project developed in Unity. This game uses factors such as heart-rate and
              microphone
              volume from the user to determine their levels of fear toward obstacles in the game, sucha as enemies or
              grave heights. The ending displays a list of what the user feared most. I developed the hospital level and
              helped manage our Jira and GitHub.
