      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>I have 3 years of coding experience with C/C++, and working
        knowledge of both Git and
        GitHub. I'm eager to help create video games and other coding and design-focused projects.
        I also have several years of experience
        programming in GameMaker Studio 2 and 2 years experience with Unity, from watching in-depth tutorials, to
        creating game prototypes.</p>

            <h3>Carrying On</h3>
            <p>For Indie City Games's Chicaghoul game jam, I created a 3D platformer with a gliding ability. I wrote all
              the code, designed all the models in Blender (besides Unity's default shapes), created character
              animations with Blender and Unity's animation system, and created a game design document listing required
              and desired
              elements. This prototype was completed in less than 3 weeks and placed in the top 50% for "engagement".

            <h3>Qubbit The Magnificent</h3>
            <p>
              For LCAD's Quantum Game Jam, I acted as a co-programmer for a 7-person team creating a quantum puzzle
              game. I studied the
              experimental quantum-simulating Unity plugin and implemented most of the gameplay-focused code, including
              player
              movement and card-flipping. This game was completed in 9 days.

            <h3>Catch Your Breath</h3>
            <p>For Brackeys Game Jam 2024.2, I lead a 5-person team to create an on-rails, rhythm-based game. I wrote
              all
              the
              code for the Unity project, created the game design document to provide a general idea of the game and the
              assets needed to realize our vision, and designed the menu background art. This game was completed in 7
              days, and placed in the top 25% overall.

            <p>In this 2-player multilateral competition game, each player takes turns launching themselves towards
              the face of a human in the center of the
              level. They must avoid traps and launch themselves above objects to reach the face before the other
              player. This game was coursework done in CS 426, in the Department of CS at the University of Illinois
              Chicago. I pitched the original game idea and acted as the project manager in a 3-person team.</p>

              University of
              Illinois Chicago, each industrial detergent interaction worsens the surrounding water. Meanwhile, the
              pineapple cleaner interactions demonstrate the steps for creating detergent with pineapple scraps, with
              a cleaner, livelier body of water as a result. This was a interdisciplinary

              graphic design classmates for a creative coding course.</p>

              As the final project for our User Interface Design course, we
              focused on making a website that gardeners could easily understand. This was a 4-person team
              project developed throughout the semester. Works best on mobile devices.

            <p>A classmate and I developed the 'Mini Follow & Fool Arcade' (formerly known as 'Mini Simon Says
              Arcade') for our computer hardware course. This is a small
              arcade-like device where two players can play a simple game similar to the Simon Says children’s game,
              where players must follow the commands of the CPU-controlled leader, using buttons and a
              joystick. The game is played through one controller Arduino, and visually displayed through
              a display Arduino connected to an LCD screen, with a buzzer attached to the display as well.

              factors such as heart rate and
              microphone volume from the user to determine their levels of fear toward obstacles in the game (such as
              enemies, eerie rooms, and perilous heights). The ending displays a list of what the user feared most.

            <p>I started this independent project late Summer of 2022, in an attempt to develop a full game. This
              high-score game challenges the player to dig for treasure and avoid obstacles for as
              long as possible. Currently incomplete. I've developed most assets and code myself (with the help of
              tutorials and forums, of course).
              <br>
              Use Left/Right keys to move and Space to drill down. Collect worms to maintain your stamina and drill
              through rocks to avoid slowing down or dying. Use P key for power-ups, D key for debug mode, and Escape
              key for pausing.
