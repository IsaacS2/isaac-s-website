      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>I have 3 years of coding experience with C/C++, and working
        knowledge of both Git and
        GitHub. I'm eager to help create video games and other coding and design-focused projects.
        I also have several years of experience
        programming in GameMaker Studio 2, from watching in-depth tutorials, to creating game prototypes.</p>

            <h3>Mask Mayhem</h3>
            <p>In this 2-player multilateral competition game, each player takes turns launching themselves towards
              the face of a human in the center of the
              level. They must avoid traps and launch themselves above objects to reach the face before the other
              player. This game was coursework done in CS 426, in the Department of CS at the University of Illinois
              Chicago. I pitched the original game idea and acted as the project manager in a 3-person team.</p>

            <p>In this VR project for the CAVE2™ Virtual Environment in the Electronic Visualization Lab at the
              University of
              Illinois Chicago, each industrial detergent interaction worsens the surrounding water. Meanwhile, the
              pineapple cleaner interactions demonstrate the steps for creating detergent with pineapple scraps, with
              a cleaner, livelier body of water as a result. This was a interdisciplinary
              semester-long project completed alongside 2
              graphic design classmates for a creative coding course.</p>

            <h3>Pest Guard</h3>
            <p>This prototype website, named Pest Guard, aims to solve the issue that gardeners face in regards to
              pests, weeds, and figuring out how to deal with them.
              As the final project for our User Interface Design course, we
              focused on making a website that gardeners could easily understand. This was a 4-person team
              project developed throughout the semester. Works best on mobile devices.

            <h3>Follow & Fool</h3>
            <p>A classmate and I developed the 'Mini Follow & Fool Arcade' (formerly known as 'Mini Simon Says
              Arcade') for our computer hardware course. This is a small
              arcade-like device where two players can play a simple game similar to the Simon Says children’s game,
              where players must follow the commands of the CPU-controlled leader, using buttons and a
              joystick. The game is played through one controller Arduino, and visually displayed through
              a display Arduino connected to an LCD screen, with a buzzer attached to the display as well.

            <h3>Dynamic VR Horror Game</h3>
            <p>This was a 4-person project developed in Unity for our Software Engineering course. This game uses
              factors such as heart rate and
              microphone volume from the user to determine their levels of fear toward obstacles in the game (such as
              enemies, eerie rooms, and perilous heights). The ending displays a list of what the user feared most.
              I developed the hospital level and helped manage our Jira and meeting notes during the semester.

            <h3>Mole Boy</h3>
            <p>I started this independent project late Summer of 2022, in an attempt to develop a full game. This
              high-score game challenges the player to dig for treasure and avoid obstacles for as
              long as possible. I plan to create a public prototype this summer to gauge enjoyment and interest from
              testers. I've developed most assets and code myself (with the help of tutorials and forums, of course).
              <br>
              Use Left/Right keys to move and Space to drill down. Collect worms to maintain your stamina and drill
              through rocks to avoid slowing down or dying. Use P key for power-ups, D key for debug mode, and Escape
              key for pausing.
